# cardware-generator
Simple word list generator in the spirit of DiceWare, but augmented with playing cards.

The provided sample word list is a combination of the [original DiceWare word list](http://world.std.com/~reinhold/diceware.wordlist.asc), the [Beale alternative DiceWare word list](http://world.std.com/~reinhold/beale.wordlist.asc), and word lists from the [google-10000-english](https://github.com/first20hours/google-10000-english) github repository.  The word lists were concatenated, deduplicated, and sorted alphabetically.
